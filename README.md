# UGAHacks2023
Find Your Paradise

The goal of this Hackathon is to harness numerous datasets across vastly different areas in life and make correlations within the data. Then design an interface to query this data to deliver the user with a scoring system output for optimal happiness in where they should most likely want to live. Users should be given choices in an easy-to-use form that when submitted will generate a unique set of scores based on locations.
Every person’s definition of what make them happy can vary depending on several factors. For the purpose of this challenge, we have narrowed these factors to four (4) categories:

•	Crime
 
•	Environment (Weather)

•	Health
 
•	Education

Crime – A dataset by US State with crimes between 2018-2021 is provided. Data points can include the number of crimes by State and Violent Crimes by State.

Climate – A dataset of Storm Data in the US over the last 10 years will be provided. Data Points can include amount of storms by State.

Health – A mortality rate by State from 1980 to 2020 dataset will be provided. Data points can include total mortality and/or average mortality by year and State.

Education – A dataset of the number of public and private schools by State will be provided. Data points include total school by State and percentage of Private Schools available to the Total Schools by State.  

Final Product to be Judged

Data points will be created for each category, sorted by US State. The product should be able to allow selection of one or all categories, and then weigh each category in order of importance. Based on the weigh a score will be generated for each category selected and a "Top 10" list of States with their weighed scores will be displayed.
